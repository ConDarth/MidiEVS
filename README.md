# MidiEVS
This repository holds the files and code for my Electronic Valve Synthesizer (EVS). 
This work is based on the work of Neil Steiner in creation of the first Electronic Valve Instrument (EVI), 
and Johan Berglund in his revival of the instrument (nuEVI).
My EVS began as an attempt to mimic Johan Berglund and create a Midi controller in the style of a trumpet, 
but it grew beyond that. Currently the goal of this project is to create a midi controller synthesizer. 
It will idealy be controlable in an identical fashion to Johan Berglunds nuEVI,
while also containing within a fully polyphonic synthesizer.
This synth would be controllable from buttons and dials fitted to the top open space of the EVS's panel.
In theory the synth would provide either USB midi output, 5-pin DIN midi output, audio jack sound output from the synthesizer, 
or output from on board speakers.
